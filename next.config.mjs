  /**
   * SECURITY HEADERS — a hardening baseline, deliberately NOT a vendor allowlist.
   *
   * THE TRADEOFF, stated plainly. The threat is that Calendly's and cal.com's widget scripts run
   * in OUR origin (loadScript injects them into our document, not the iframe) on a page holding
   * the booking token and the buyer's name and email. The CSP directive that would actually bound
   * that is `connect-src` pinned to a vendor list — and that is exactly the directive that breaks
   * a practitioner's scheduler when a vendor adds a host we did not predict.
   *
   * An earlier draft of this file did pin `connect-src` and `frame-src` to enumerated vendor
   * hosts. That was wrong for this product, for the same reason the iframe sandbox allowlist was
   * wrong: it silently breaks a real practitioner's booking page and looks like a provider
   * outage. It had already missed one — Acuity's embed loads a Datadog SDK from a host that was
   * not on the list. Enumerating a third party's infrastructure is a guess that ages badly, and
   * the operator ruling is to trust the practitioner's vendor and keep the flow seamless.
   *
   * So `connect-src`, `frame-src` and `img-src` are `https:` — any HTTPS host. What is still
   * enforced costs nothing and cannot break a scheduler:
   *   object-src 'none'      no plugin content, ever
   *   base-uri 'self'        a `<base>` injection cannot repoint every relative URL
   *   frame-ancestors 'none' we cannot be framed (clickjacking on a payment flow)
   *   form-action 'self'     our own forms cannot be repointed; the scheduler's forms live in
   *                          its own document under its own policy, so this does not touch them
   *   the `https:` floor     blocks data:/blob:-sourced scripts and mixed content
   *
   * `script-src` keeps 'unsafe-inline'/'unsafe-eval' because the App Router ships inline
   * bootstrap and flight scripts; removing them needs per-request nonces in middleware. That is
   * the real next step if this is ever tightened — not a vendor allowlist.
