 * `listedWhere()` conflates two unrelated predicates: profile COMPLETENESS (displayName, city,
 * bio, specialties) and BILLING standing. That is right for the directory, which is a promotional
 * surface, and wrong for the booking flow, which was rejecting people for both reasons:
 *
 *   - A practitioner mid-onboarding with no bio could not take a lead through her own link.
 *   - A practitioner past her trial had a live profile whose Book buttons 404'd — contradicting
 *     trial-sweep's own warning email, which promises the profile "stays live at its direct link,
 *     but stops appearing in directory search".
 *
 * So booking gates on ONE thing: the row has not been retired. A retired row is an operator
 * artefact — a duplicate created by a corrected email, or a test listing — and is typically owned
 * by a mailbox nobody reads. `sarah-schindler` is exactly that: retired 2026-08-12, owner
 * `hello@livingaligned.love`, which Sarah confirmed on the 2026-08-11 call is dead. Capturing a
 * lead there sends it to no one while telling the buyer their details were received.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTE WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not test billing standing, so a practitioner
 * whose trial lapsed keeps a working checkout. That follows from the operator's rule that unlisted
 * profiles stay bookable, and today no row is in that state (every live trialEndsAt is null). It
 * becomes a live policy question the moment `scripts/backfill-trial-dates.ts` starts the pilot
 * clocks — flagged rather than decided here.
