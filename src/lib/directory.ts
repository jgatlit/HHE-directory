/*
 * The landing page's read model.
 *
 * Replaces the frontier sandbox's generated `src/content/directory-data.ts`
 * fixture with the live query. The shapes below are the sandbox's, minus the
 * fields that existed only to substantiate the four claims held on 2026-08-10
 * (`firstSessionPriceCents`, `bookingLinkCount`, `hheCertified`) — carrying them
 * with no consumer would invite someone to re-render a held claim without
 * checking its acceptance test in docs/brand/2026-08-10-client-landing-copy.md.
 *
 * `listedWhere()` is the only filter. It is the same gate that drives Typesense
 * indexing, so the home page and /search can never disagree about who is listed.
 * No operator-account exclusion is layered on top: the two operator profiles are
 * unlisted at the data layer (no specialties), and a `role: { not: 'ADMIN' }`
 * filter would instead drop Amy Sprouse, who is both an ADMIN and a real
 * practitioner.
