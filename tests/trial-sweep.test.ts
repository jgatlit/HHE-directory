/**
 * Covers `/api/cron/trial-sweep` — the cron that warns pilots before their trial ends and then
 * DELISTS the ones that have lapsed.
 *
 * This route had no tests until the sender underneath it was replaced, which is backwards: it
 * emails real practitioners and its second half is the only thing that actually applies the
 * paywall. The assertions below are deliberately about its FAILURE behaviour, because that is
 * what nobody exercises by hand:
 *
 *   - a bad send must not abort the run, and must not skip enforcement
 *   - a bad send must be counted AND attributed, never swallowed
 *   - a missing API key must fail loudly, not report "sent: 0" as success
 *
 * The last one is the failure this repo keeps re-learning: a silent no-op is indistinguishable
 * from a clean run, and `deleteFromIndex`'s bare catch left its own counter at zero for weeks.
